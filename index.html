  <p>Stop the Spread:</p>
  <p> Testable: the iv will be affected by the dv because only one of the spots will have the most bacteria</p>
  
  <p>Independent Variable:   The one thing that we are going to change is the spot to see where the most bacteria will be, the bathroom, the stairs, the classroom, the wall way, or the grand stairs.	Dependent Variable: We will measure the amount of bacteria in the two areas.</p>
  
  <p>Constants: we will keep the same amount of space so we can see which spot has the most bacteria</p>
  
  <p>Hypothesis: i think that the class room or the grand stairs will have the most bacteria.</p>

  <p>Bacteria are single-celled prokaryotic creatures.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Due to their thicker cell walls and peptidoglycan&apos;s ability to bind to crystal violet, gram-positive cells are purple in hue.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Gram-negative cells have a thinner cell wall, which gives them a pink color.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Up to 200 microns can be moved by a single bacterium every second.</p>

<p>We discovered that the great steps do not contain the highest concentration of microorganisms. This is due to frequent usage of the restroom and my assumption that some users do not wash their hands. which only adds to the stench. It could be that they cleaned the stairs that day or that the boy&apos;s restroom had whatever was present because when we went to the area where the grand staircase was believed to have the most bacteria. Once the bacteria grew, we discovered that the bacteria in the boys restroom had more bacteria than the grand staircase.</p>
